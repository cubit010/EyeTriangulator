# EyeTriangulator
Ender eye for triangulating strongholds in Minecraft using 2 eyes

Java Only (as copying coordinates in bedrock does not copy angles)

Throw an eye, and do not move as you aim the right side of the crosshair at the line one pixel left of the center of the eye as close as possible, and press f3+c to record your character's coordinates and orientation. Then, head to another location and repeat, and the program will output the intersection coordinate and its Nether counterpart for easy blind travel. 

The program also accounts for ±0.3 degrees to either side, which is the darker green area inside the eye, preferably one should aim within this area for maximum accuracy of the triangulator. The triangulator will find the quadrilateral generated by the deviation of ±0.3 degrees, and that is the largest possible search area.

The program also implements an algorithm that calculates the max radius one needs to search from the center, and the radius one needs to search in order to have a 95% confidence rate in the stronghold location.

The program will also generate a bounding box for easier understanding of the search area.
